## Introduction

This is the second Milestone Project with Code Institute.

This Project will just have HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This is a simple Hangman Game were you guess what letters come into the spaces.

## Planning

### Colour Pallet

### Technology Used

- figma—designing the wire frame diagram
- GitHub and Jetbrains Spaces—version control system

Comparison of using GitHub and Jetbrains Spaces.

The reason that I decided to use the two version control systems, was I wanted to explore more of their products, as
their products are good and I enjoy using them.

GitHub

| Pros                                      | Cons                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Most popular version control system       | very basic features                |
| Easy to create a new repository           | difficult to organise repositories |
| Can create private or public repositories |                                    |

Jetbrains Spaces

| Pros                                                   | Cons                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lots of nice features                                  | Only has limited features on the free version                   |
| Easy to setup and mirror other version control systems | Can be expensive                                                |
| Excellent tool for using in collaboration              | Can't mix different paid plans                                  |
| Integrates well with Jetbrains products                | Not that easy to move cards accross, as there seems to be a bug |
| Easy to organise repositories into projects            | Can only create private repositories                            |

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere.
If you are using Gitpod,
then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.
We have preinstalled all the tools you need to get started.
It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere, you have superuser security privileges by default.
Therefore, you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku tool belt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works.
This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it.
If you accidentally make it public, then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
